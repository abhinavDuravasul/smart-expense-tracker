    //ONE LINE SUMMARY ABT THE PROJECT

//‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a secure, backend-only REST API that helps users track their personal expenses, categorized by type, with support for reports and authentication.‚Äù

//    ‚ÄúThe Smart Expense Tracker API is a backend project built in Java using Spring Boot. It allows users to securely manage their daily expenses. Users can sign up, log in with JWT-based authentication, and then add expenses by category, amount, and description. The API supports viewing, editing, and deleting expenses. I also added pagination and filtering features for better UX, and created a scheduled job that generates monthly reports. I used layered architecture with DTOs, services, and JPA repositories, and documented all the APIs with Swagger.
//    The backend is fully secure and ready to be consumed by any frontend or mobile app.‚Äù

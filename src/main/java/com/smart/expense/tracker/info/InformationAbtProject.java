//    🧑‍💻 Resume Section Example
//    Personal Project – Smart Expense Tracker API
//    Built a RESTful backend using Java 21 and Spring Boot to manage personal expenses. Implemented secure user access with JWT, categorized expenses, and enabled monthly reporting via scheduled jobs.
//
//    Tech Stack: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, PostgreSQL, JPA, JWT, JUnit, Swagger
//    Key Features:
//
//    Modular architecture with DTOs, Entities, Services, and Repositories
//
//    User authentication with token-based security
//
//    Category filtering, pagination, and CRUD operations
//
//    Scheduled job for monthly summary export
//
//    API documentation using Swagger UI


    //ONE LINE SUMMARY ABT THE PROJECT

//“It’s a secure, backend-only REST API that helps users track their personal expenses, categorized by type, with support for reports and authentication.”

//    “The Smart Expense Tracker API is a backend project built in Java using Spring Boot.
//    It allows users to securely manage their daily expenses.
//    Users can sign up, log in with JWT-based authentication, and then add expenses by category, amount, and description.
//    The API supports viewing, editing, and deleting expenses. I also added pagination and filtering features for better UX, and created a scheduled job that generates monthly reports.
//    I used layered architecture with DTOs, services, and JPA repositories, and documented all the APIs with Swagger.
//    The backend is fully secure and ready to be consumed by any frontend or mobile app.”

//🛠 Bonus Tip
//If asked “Why did you build it?”, you can say:

//        “I wanted to build a project that solves a common real-world problem — tracking personal expenses
//        — while using Java backend technologies that I work with in my job. It helped me reinforce concepts
//        like API design, security, data validation, and scheduling.
